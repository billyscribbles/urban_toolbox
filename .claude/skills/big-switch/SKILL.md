# The Big Switch — new client site orchestration

This skill drives the workflow defined in `CLAUDE.md` ("The Big Switch") from
brief to live site. `CLAUDE.md` is the source of truth for *what* each step
does; this skill is the *order of operations* and tells you which other skills
to invoke at each beat. Read `CLAUDE.md` first, then follow this.

## Step 0 — Confirm the brief (never skip)

Ask Billy for anything missing, then stop and wait for answers:

1. Business name + one-line tagline
2. Industry / what they do
3. Brand colors or a vibe ("dark luxury", "minimal pastel", "bold tech")
4. Logo asset path, or "generate a text logo"
5. Nav pages (default: Home, Services, About, Contact)
6. Domain (for SEO) and Formspree ID
7. Sections to drop from the default set

Do not guess brand identity.

## Step 1 — Isolate the workspace

Default: clone this foundation into a sibling dir
(`/Users/billyhuynh/Github/<client-name>`) and work there. Never commit
client-specific changes back into `foundation/` itself. Only edit in place if
Billy explicitly says so — and warn him first.

## Step 2 — Execute the swap (in order)

Follow `CLAUDE.md` Step 2 exactly:

1. `src/config/site.config.js` — brand, nav, footer, social, SEO, contact, IDs
2. `src/config/theme.config.js` — colors, fonts, radii (+ `public/fonts/` and
   the `index.html` preload block if using custom fonts)
3. `public/brand/` — `logo.svg`, `favicon.svg`, `og-image` (ship a 1200×630
   **PNG/JPG** — social platforms do not render SVG previews)
4. `src/content/*.js` — rewrite every section with real marketing copy
5. `.env` — `VITE_FORMSPREE_ID`, `VITE_SITE_URL`; optionally `VITE_GA_ID`
   (analytics) and `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` (error monitoring). Both observability
   helpers no-op when left blank — see README.
6. `index.html` — fallback `<title>`, meta, og/twitter image
7. `public/sitemap.xml` / `public/robots.txt` — leave the placeholder domain;
   `yarn build` rewrites it from `VITE_SITE_URL` via `scripts/gen-seo-files.mjs`

Invoke supporting skills during the swap:

- **`impeccable`** / **`design-taste-frontend`** — when proposing or polishing
  the theme and section layout
- **`accessibility`** — after content is in, to audit the assembled pages
- **`seo`** — to review meta, structured data, and `sitemap.xml`

## Step 3 — Add/remove pages

Per `CLAUDE.md` Step 3: extra section → new `src/content/<name>.js` + closest
component cloned; extra page → lazy route in `src/App.jsx`; remove a section →
delete it from `src/pages/Home.jsx` composition only.

## Step 4 — Verify end-to-end

Run the full `CLAUDE.md` Step 4 checklist. Do not declare done until every item
passes. Key automated gates: `yarn lint` (incl. jsx-a11y), `yarn test` (contract
+ axe suite), `yarn build`, and Lighthouse ≥ 90 / 95 / 90. Report results with
evidence, not vibes.

## Step 5 — Deploy

Hand off to the **`railway-deploy`** skill. After deploy, re-verify every route
and the contact form on the live domain.
