# Railway deploy — Foundation client sites

Deploys a site built from the Foundation template to Railway, using the Railway
MCP server (configured in `.mcp.json`). This is Step 5 of "The Big Switch" —
the `big-switch` skill hands off here once the site verifies locally.

## Prerequisites — check before deploying

1. `railway.json` exists at the repo root (it ships with the template):
   NIXPACKS builder, `startCommand: yarn start`, restart-on-failure.
2. `package.json` has a `start` script — `vite preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4173`.
3. `yarn build` passes locally and `yarn lint && yarn test` are green. Never
   deploy a build you have not verified.
4. The Railway MCP tools are available (`mcp__railway__*`). If not, tell the user
   to add the railway MCP server or run `railway login` themselves.

## First deploy — new project

1. `mcp__railway__check-railway-status` — confirm auth.
2. `mcp__railway__list-projects` — check the client doesn't already have one.
3. `mcp__railway__create-project-and-link` — create the project and link this
   repo directory to it.
4. `mcp__railway__link-service` (and `link-environment` if prompted) — attach
   the service Railway provisions.
5. **Set environment variables** with `mcp__railway__set-variables` — mirror the
   site's `.env`:
   - `VITE_FORMSPREE_ID` — required for the contact form
   - `VITE_SITE_URL` — required; the build templates `sitemap.xml`/`robots.txt`
     from it via `scripts/gen-seo-files.mjs`
   - `VITE_GA_ID` — only if the client uses analytics
   - `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` — only if the client uses error monitoring
   These are build-time vars (Vite inlines `VITE_*`), so they must be set
   **before** the deploy build runs.
6. `mcp__railway__deploy` — trigger the deploy.
7. `mcp__railway__generate-domain` — get a public URL (or attach the client's
   custom domain in the Railway dashboard).

## Redeploy / update env vars

- Changed code: `mcp__railway__deploy` again.
- Changed config: `mcp__railway__set-variables`, then redeploy — `VITE_*` vars
  only take effect on the next build.
- Inspect current vars: `mcp__railway__list-variables`.

## Troubleshooting

- `mcp__railway__list-deployments` — deployment history and status.
- `mcp__railway__get-logs` — build or runtime logs. Most failures are a missing
  env var or a build that wasn't verified locally first.

## After every deploy — verify on the live domain

1. Every route loads: `/`, `/services`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/privacy`,
   `/terms`, and a 404 path.
2. The contact form submits against the real Formspree endpoint.
3. `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` show the real domain (not `example.com`).
4. Re-run a Lighthouse check on the live URL.

Report results with evidence — the live URL and what you observed — not vibes.
